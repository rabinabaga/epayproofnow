# E-PayProof now

**E-PayProof now** is a blockchain-based platform designed for secure and immutable electronic payment verification. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, security, and ease of access to payment proofs stored on the blockchain. The system uses smart contracts for automatic verification of transactions and secure storage of payment proofs.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Payment Verification**: All payment proofs are verified and stored on the blockchain for transparency and immutability.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Payment proofs are generated and validated using Ethereum smart contracts, reducing the risk of fraud.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Payment proofs are securely stored, ensuring they cannot be tampered with or altered.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive frontend for users to upload payment details and access verified proofs.
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Supports various electronic payment methods for greater accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (with Solidity for smart contracts)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: React.js (for UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (for interacting with the blockchain and handling API requests)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for off-chain storage of user and transaction data)
- **Web3.js**: To interact with Ethereum and smart contracts
- **IPFS (Optional)**: For decentralized file storage of receipts and payment documents

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Truffle or Hardhat (for compiling and deploying Ethereum smart contracts)
- MetaMask (or any Ethereum wallet)
- Ganache (optional, for local Ethereum testing)
- MongoDB (if using MongoDB as the database)
